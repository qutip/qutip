    Runs the given function in parallel over the PiCloud cluster.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        Function to run in parallel.
        
    In addition to the function 'func' to be run in parallel, the picloud
    function accepts a series of arguments that are passed to the function
    as variables. In general, the function can have multiple input variables, 
    and these arguments must be passed in the same order as they are defined in
    the function definition.
    
    Furthermore, several keyword arguments may be given that set the settings
    for the PiCloud cluster:
    
    _type - Type of core used in picloud: 'c1', 'c2', 'f2' (default), 'm1', 's1'
    _cores - Number of cores used: 1 (default)
    _env - Custom environment for computation.  Set to current version of qutip.
    _label - Provide a label for the current computation.
    
    For more information see the PiCloud website: http://www.picloud.com/
