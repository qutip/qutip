def mesolve(H, rho0, tlist, c_ops=None, e_ops=None, args=None, options=None):
    """
    Master equation evolution of a density matrix for a given Hamiltonian and
    set of collapse operators, or a Liouvillian.

    Evolve the state vector or density matrix (`rho0`) using a given
    Hamiltonian or Liouvillian (`H`) and an optional set of collapse operators
    (`c_ops`), by integrating the set of ordinary differential equations
    that define the system. In the absence of collapse operators the system is
    evolved according to the unitary evolution of the Hamiltonian.

    The output is either the state vector at arbitrary points in time
    (`tlist`), or the expectation values of the supplied operators
    (`e_ops`). If e_ops is a callback function, it is invoked for each
    time in `tlist` with time and the state as arguments, and the function
    does not use any return values.

    If either `H` or the Qobj elements in `c_ops` are superoperators, they
    will be treated as direct contributions to the total system Liouvillian.
    This allows the solution of master equations that are not in standard
    Lindblad form.

    **Time-dependent operators**

    For time-dependent problems, `H` and `c_ops` can be a :class:`QobjEvo` or
    object that can be interpreted as :class:`QobjEvo` such as a list of
    (Qobj, Coefficient) pairs or a function.

    **Additional options**

    Additional options to mesolve can be set via the `options` argument. Many
    ODE integration options can be set this way, and the `store_states` and
    `store_final_state` options can be used to store states even though
    expectation values are requested via the `e_ops` argument.

    .. note::

        When no collapse operator are given and the `H` is not a superoperator,
        it will defer to :func:`sesolve`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    H : :class:`Qobj`, :class:`QobjEvo`, :class:`QobjEvo` compatible format.
        Possibly time-dependent system Liouvillian or Hamiltonian as a Qobj or QobjEvo.
        list of [:class:`Qobj`, :class:`Coefficient`] or callable that can be
        made into :class:`QobjEvo` are also accepted.

    rho0 : :class:`Qobj`
        initial density matrix or state vector (ket).

    tlist : *list* / *array*
        list of times for :math:`t`.

    c_ops : list of (:class:`QobjEvo`, :class:`QobjEvo` compatible format)
        Single collapse operator, or list of collapse operators, or a list
        of Liouvillian superoperators. None is equivalent to an empty list.

    e_ops : list of :class:`Qobj` / callback function
        Single operator or list of operators for which to evaluate
        expectation values or callable or list of callable.
        Callable signature must be, `f(t: float, state: Qobj)`.
        See :func:`expect` for more detail of operator expectation.

    args : None / *dictionary*
        dictionary of parameters for time-dependent Hamiltonians and
        collapse operators.

    options : None / dict / :class:`Options`
        Options for the solver.

    Returns
    -------
    result: :class:`qutip.Result`

        An instance of the class :class:`qutip.Result`, which contains
        a *list of array* `result.expect` of expectation values for the times
        specified by `tlist`, and/or a *list* `result.states` of state vectors
        or density matrices corresponding to the times in `tlist` [if `e_ops`
        is an empty list of `store_states=True` in options].
