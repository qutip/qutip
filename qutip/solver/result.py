    Base class for storing solver results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    e_ops : :obj:`.Qobj`, :obj:`.QobjEvo`, function or list or dict of these
        The ``e_ops`` parameter defines the set of values to record at
        each time step ``t``. If an element is a :obj:`.Qobj` or
        :obj:`.QobjEvo` the value recorded is the expectation value of that
        operator given the state at ``t``. If the element is a function, ``f``,
        the value recorded is ``f(t, state)``.

        The values are recorded in the ``e_data`` and ``expect`` attributes of
        this result object. ``e_data`` is a dictionary and ``expect`` is a
        list, where each item contains the values of the corresponding
        ``e_op``.

    options : dict
        The options for this result class.

    solver : str or None
        The name of the solver generating these results.

    stats : dict or None
        The stats generated by the solver while producing these results. Note
        that the solver may update the stats directly while producing results.

    kw : dict
        Additional parameters specific to a result sub-class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    times : list
        A list of the times at which the expectation values and states were
        recorded.

    states : list of :obj:`.Qobj`
        The state at each time ``t`` (if the recording of the state was
        requested).

    final_state : :obj:`.Qobj`:
        The final state (if the recording of the final state was requested).

    expect : list of arrays of expectation values
        A list containing the values of each ``e_op``. The list is in
        the same order in which the ``e_ops`` were supplied and empty if
        no ``e_ops`` were given.

        Each element is itself a list and contains the values of the
        corresponding ``e_op``, with one value for each time in ``.times``.

        The same lists of values may be accessed via the ``.e_data`` dictionary
        and the original ``e_ops`` are available via the ``.e_ops`` attribute.

    e_data : dict
        A dictionary containing the values of each ``e_op``. If the ``e_ops``
        were supplied as a dictionary, the keys are the same as in
        that dictionary. Otherwise the keys are the index of the ``e_op``
        in the ``.expect`` list.

        The lists of expectation values returned are the *same* lists as
        those returned by ``.expect``.

    e_ops : dict
        A dictionary containing the supplied e_ops as ``ExpectOp`` instances.
        The keys of the dictionary are the same as for ``.e_data``.
        Each value is object where ``.e_ops[k](t, state)`` calculates the
        value of ``e_op`` ``k`` at time ``t`` and the given ``state``, and
        ``.e_ops[k].op`` is the original object supplied to create the
        ``e_op``.

    solver : str or None
        The name of the solver generating these results.

    Class for storing the results of the non-Markovian Monte-Carlo solver.

    Parameters
    ----------
    e_ops : :obj:`.Qobj`, :obj:`.QobjEvo`, function or list or dict of these
        The ``e_ops`` parameter defines the set of values to record at
        each time step ``t``. If an element is a :obj:`.Qobj` or
        :obj:`.QobjEvo` the value recorded is the expectation value of that
        operator given the state at ``t``. If the element is a function, ``f``,
        the value recorded is ``f(t, state)``.

        The values are recorded in the ``.expect`` attribute of this result
        object. ``.expect`` is a list, where each item contains the values
        of the corresponding ``e_op``.

    options : :obj:`~SolverResultsOptions`
        The options for this result class.

    solver : str or None
        The name of the solver generating these results.

    stats : dict
        The stats generated by the solver while producing these results. Note
        that the solver may update the stats directly while producing results.
        Must include a value for "num_collapse".

    kw : dict
        Additional parameters specific to a result sub-class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    average_trace : list
        The average trace (i.e., averaged over all trajectories) at each time.

    std_trace : list
        The standard deviation of the trace at each time.

    runs_trace : list of lists
        For each recorded trajectory, the trace at each time.
        Only present if ``keep_runs_results`` is set in the options.
