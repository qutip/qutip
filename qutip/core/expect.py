def expect(oper, state):
    """
    Calculate the expectation value for operator(s) and state(s).  The
    expectation of state `k` on operator `A` is defined as `k.dag() @ A @ k`,
    and for density matrix `R` on operator `A` it is `trace(A @ R)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    oper : qobj/array-like
        A single or a `list` or operators for expectation value.

    state : qobj/array-like
        A single or a `list` of quantum states or density matrices.

    Returns
    -------
    expt : float/complex/array-like
        Expectation value.  ``real`` if `oper` is Hermitian, ``complex``
        otherwise. A (nested) array of expectaction values of state or operator
        are arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> expect(num(4), basis(4, 3))
    3
