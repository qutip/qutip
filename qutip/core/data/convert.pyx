cdef class _to:
    """
    Convert data into a different type.  This object is the knowledge source
    for every allowable data-layer type in QuTiP, and provides the conversions
    between all of them.

    The base use is to call this object as a function with signature
        (type, data) -> converted_data
    where `type` is a type object (such as `data.CSR`, or that obtained by
    calling `type(matrix)`) and `data` is data in a data-layer type.  If you
    want to create a data-layer type from non-data-layer data, use `create`
    instead.

    You can get individual converters by using the key-lookup syntax.  For
    example, the item
        to[CSR, Dense]
    is a callable which accepts arguments of type `Dense` and returns the
    equivalent item of type `CSR`.  You can also get a generic converter to a
    particular data type if only one type is specified, so
        to[Dense]
    is a callable which accepts all known (at the time of the lookup)
    data-layer types, and converts them to `Dense`.  See the `Efficiency notes`
    section below for more detail.

    Internally, the conversion process may go through several steps if new
    data-layer types have been defined with few conversions specified between
    them and the pre-existing converters.  The first-class QuTiP data types
    `Dense` and `CSR` will typically have the best connectivity.


    Adding new types
    ----------------
    You can add new data-layer types by calling the `add_conversions` method of
    this object, and then rebuilding all of the mathematical dispatchers.  See
    the docstring of that method for more information.


    Efficiency notes
    ----------------
    From an efficiency perspective, there is very little benefit to using the
    key-lookup syntax.  Internally, `to(to_type, data)` effectively calls
    `to[to_type, type(data)]`, so storing the object elides the creation of a
    single tuple and a dict lookup, but the cost of this is generally less than
    500ns.  Using the one-argument lookup (e.g. `to[Dense]`) is no more
    efficient than the general call at all, but can be used in cases where a
    single callable is required and is more efficient than `functools.partial`.

        which produces an existing data type from the new one.  You need not

        Parameters
        ----------
        converters : iterable of (to_type, from_type, converter, [weight])
            An iterable of 3- or 4-tuples describing all the new conversions.
            Each element can individually be a 3- or 4-tuple; they do not need
            to be all one or the other.

            Elements
            ........
            to_type : type
                The data-layer type that is output by the converter.

            from_type : type
                The data-layer type to be input to the converter.

            converter : callable (Data -> Data)
                The converter function.  This should take a single argument
                (the input data-layer function) and output a data-layer object
                of `to_type`.  The converter may assume without error checking
                that its input will always be of `to_type`.  It is safe to
                specify the same conversion function for multiple inputs so
                long as the function handles them all safely, but it must
                always return a single output type.

            weight : positive real, optional (1)
                The weight associated with this conversion.  This must be > 0,
                and defaults to `1` if not supplied (which is fixed to be the
                cost of conversion to `Dense` from `CSR`).  It is generally
                safe just to leave this blank; it is always at best an
                approximation.  The currently defined weights are accessible in
                the `weights` attribute of this object.
                Weight of ~0.001 are should be used in case when no conversion
                is needed or ``converter = lambda mat : mat``.

        _defer : bool, optional (False)
            Only intended for internal library use during initialisation. If
            `True`, the full lookup tables is not built and the added types

        Default creators are added with the following priorities:

        * Objects that are instances of data-layer types are
          converted using ``.copy`` with priority 100.
        * Objects that have a direct equivalent such as ``numpy.ndarray``
          or ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`` are converted with priority 80.
        * Objects for which ``scipy.sparse.issparse`` is ``True``
          are converted using an internal CSR converter with
          priority 20.
        * If no condition are meet, ``numpy.array`` is used to try convert
          the input to an array (priority -inf).
