    Parameters
    ----------
    oper : qobj/array-like
        A single or a `list` or operators for expectation value.

    state : qobj/array-like
        A single or a `list` of quantum states or density matrices.

    Returns
    -------
    expt : float/complex/array-like
        Expectation value.  ``real`` if `oper` is Hermitian, ``complex``
        otherwise. A (nested) array of expectaction values of state or operator
        are arrays.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> expect(num(4), basis(4, 3)) == 3 # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        True
