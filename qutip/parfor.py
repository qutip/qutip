    """Executes a multi-variable function in parallel on the local machine.

    Parallel execution of a for-loop over function `func` for multiple input
    arguments and keyword arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function_type
        A function to run in parallel on the local machine. The function 'func' 
        accepts a series of arguments that are passed to the function as variables. 
        In general, the function can have multiple input variables, and these 
        arguments must be passed in the same order as they are defined in
        the function definition.  In addition, the user can pass multiple keyword
        arguments to the function.

    The following keyword argument is reserved:
    
    num_cpus : int
        Number of CPU's to use.  Default uses maximum number of CPU's. 
        Performance degrades if num_cpus is larger than the physical CPU 
        count of your machine.


    Returns
    -------
    result : list
        A ``list`` with length equal to number of input parameters
        containing the output from `func`.
