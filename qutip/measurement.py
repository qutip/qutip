def measure(op, state):
    """
    Perform a measurement specified by an operator on the given state.

    This function simulates the classic quantum measurement described
    in many introductory texts on quantum mechanics. The measurement
    collapses the state to one of the eigenstates of the given
    operator and the result of the measurement is the corresponding
    eigenvalue.

    Parameters
    ----------
    op : Qobj
        The measurement operator.
    state : Qobj
        The ket or density matrix specifying the state to measure.

    Returns
    -------
    measured_value : float
        The result of the measurement (one of the eigenvalues of op).
    state : Qobj
        The new state (a ket if a ket was given, otherwise a density
        matrix).

    Examples
    --------

    Measure the z-component of the spin of the spin-up basis state:

    >>> measure(sigmaz(), basis(2, 0))
    (1.0, Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket
    Qobj data =
    [[-1.]
     [ 0.]])

    Since the spin-up basis is an eigenstate of sigmaz, this measurement always
    returns 1 as the measurement result (the eigenvalue of the spin-up basis)
    and the original state (up to a global phase).

    Measure the x-component of the spin of the spin-down basis state:

    >>> measure(sigmax(), basis(2, 1))
    (-1.0, Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket
    Qobj data =
    [[-0.70710678]
     [ 0.70710678]])

    This measurement returns 1 fifty percent of the time and -1 the other fifty
    percent of the time. The new state returned is the corresponding eigenstate
    of sigmax.

    One may also perform a measurement on a density matrix. Below we perform
    the same measurement as above, but on the density matrix representing the
    pure spin-down state:

    >>> measure(sigmax(), ket2dm(basis(2, 1)))
    (-1.0, Quantum object: dims = [[2], [2]], shape = (2, 2), type = oper
    Qobj data =
    [[ 0.5 -0.5]
     [-0.5  0.5]])

    The measurement result is the same, but the new state is returned as a
    density matrix.
