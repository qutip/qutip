QuTiP is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of closed and open
quantum systems. The QuTiP library uses the excellent Numpy, Scipy, and Cython packages as numerical backend, and graphical output is provided by Matplotlib. QuTiP aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of a wide
variety of quantum mechanical problems, including those with Hamiltonians
and/or collapse operators with arbitrary time-dependence, commonly found in a
wide range of physics applications. QuTiP is freely available for use and/or
modification, and it can be used on all Unix-based platforms and on Windows.
Being free of any licensing fees, QuTiP is ideal for exploring quantum
mechanics in research as well as in the classroom.
