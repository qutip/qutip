QuTiP is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems.
It uses the excellent Numpy, Scipy, and Cython packages as numerical backends, and graphical output is provided by Matplotlib.
QuTiP aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of a wide variety of quantum mechanical problems, including those with Hamiltonians and/or collapse operators with arbitrary time-dependence, commonly found in a wide range of physics applications.
QuTiP is freely available for use and/or modification, and it can be used on all Unix-based platforms and on Windows.
Being free of any licensing fees, QuTiP is ideal for exploring quantum mechanics in research as well as in the classroom.

We are proud to be affiliated with [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund) and [numFOCUS](https://numfocus.org).
QuTiP development is supported by [Nori's lab](https://dml.riken.jp/) at RIKEN, by the University of Sherbrooke, and by Aberystwyth University, [among other supporting organizations](https://qutip.org/#supporting-organizations).


Installation
------------

[![Pip Package](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/qutip?logo=PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/qutip)
[![Conda-Forge Package](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/qutip?logo=Conda-Forge)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qutip)

QuTiP is available on both `pip` and `conda` (the latter in the `conda-forge` channel).
You can install QuTiP from `pip` by doing

```bash
pip install qutip
```

to get the minimal installation.
You can instead use the target `qutip[full]` to install QuTiP with all its optional dependencies.
For more details, including instructions on how to build from source, see [the detailed installation guide in the documentation](https://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html).

All back releases are also available for download in the [releases section of this repository](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/releases), where you can also find per-version changelogs.
For the most complete set of release notes and changelogs for historic versions, see the [changelog](https://qutip.org/docs/latest/changelog.html) section in the documentation.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation for official releases, in HTML and PDF formats, can be found in the [documentation section of the QuTiP website](https://qutip.org/documentation.html).
The latest development documentation is available in this repository in the `doc` folder.

A [selection of demonstration notebooks is available](https://qutip.org/tutorials.html), which demonstrate some of the many features of QuTiP.
These are stored in the [qutip/qutip-notebooks repository](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-notebooks) here on GitHub.
You can run the notebooks online using myBinder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/qutip/qutip-notebooks/master?filepath=index.ipynb)
