jobs:
  # The deploy_test job is part of the test of whether we should deploy to PyPI
  # or test.PyPI. The job will succeed if either the confirmation reference is
  # empty, 'test' or if the confirmation is the selected branch or tag name.
  # It will fail if it is nonempty and does not match.  All later jobs depend
  # on this job, so that they will be immediately cancelled if the confirmation
  # is bad.  The dependency is currently necessary (2021-03) because GitHub
  # Actions does not have a simpler method of cancelling an entire workflow---
  # the normal use-case expects to try and run as much as possible despite one
  # or two failures.
