Added a new quantum system module in QuTiP, which has ready to use implementation of various quantum systems. We have created a class called QuantumSystem, all quantum systems are instances of this class and configured by the factory functions. 
The quantum system included in this PR are the Jaynes-Cummings model and a simple qubit. We describe the operators, hamiltonian construction and some common dissipation mechanism in terms of collapse operators along latex representation of the hamiltonian.
The QuantumSystem class includes various methods that include pretty print function, ground state, eigenstates, eigenvalues, dimension etc.
