Introduction
============

Many time-dependent problems of interest are periodic. The dynamics of such systems can be solved for directly by numerical integration of the Schrödinger or Master equation, using the time-dependent Hamiltonian. But they can also be transformed into time-independent problems using the Floquet formalism. Time-independent problems can be solve much more efficiently, so such a transformation is often very desirable.

In the standard derivations of the Lindblad and Bloch-Redfield master equations the Hamiltonian describing the system under consideration is assumed to be time independent. Thus, strictly speaking, the standard forms of these master equation formalisms should not blindly be applied to system with time-dependent Hamiltonians. However, in many relevant cases, in particular for weak driving, the standard master equations still turns out to be useful for many time-dependent problems. But a more rigorous approach would be to rederive the master equation taking the time-dependent nature of the Hamiltonian into account from the start. The Floquet-Markov Master equation is one such a formalism, with important applications for strongly driven systems (see e.g., [Gri98]_).

Here we give an overview of how the Floquet and Floquet-Markov formalisms can be used for solving time-dependent problems in QuTiP. To introduce the terminology and naming conventions used in QuTiP we first give a brief summary of quantum Floquet theory.

.. _floquet-unitary:

Floquet theory for unitary evolution
====================================

The Schrödinger equation with a time-dependent Hamiltonian :math:`H(t)` is

.. math::
   :label: eq_td_schrodinger

	H(t)\Psi(t) = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(t),

where :math:`\Psi(t)` is the wave function solution. Here we are interested in problems with periodic time-dependence, i.e., the Hamiltonian satisfies :math:`H(t) = H(t+T)` where :math:`T` is the period. According to the Floquet theorem, there exist solutions to :eq:`eq_td_schrodinger` of the form

.. math::
   :label: eq_floquet_states

    \Psi_\alpha(t) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t),

where :math:`\Psi_\alpha(t)` are the *Floquet states* (i.e., the set of wave function solutions to the Schrödinger equation), :math:`\Phi_\alpha(t)=\Phi_\alpha(t+T)` are the periodic *Floquet modes*, and :math:`\epsilon_\alpha` are the *quasienergy levels*. The quasienergy levels are constants in time, but only uniquely defined up to multiples of :math:`2\pi/T` (i.e., unique value in the interval :math:`[0, 2\pi/T]`).

If we know the Floquet modes (for :math:`t \in [0,T]`) and the quasienergies for a particular :math:`H(t)`, we can easily decompose any initial wavefunction :math:`\Psi(t=0)` in the Floquet states and immediately obtain the solution for arbitrary :math:`t`

.. math::
   :label: eq_floquet_wavefunction_expansion

    \Psi(t) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha \Psi_\alpha(t) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t),

where the coefficients :math:`c_\alpha` are determined by the initial wavefunction :math:`\Psi(0) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha \Psi_\alpha(0)`.

This formalism is useful for finding :math:`\Psi(t)` for a given :math:`H(t)` only if we can obtain the Floquet modes :math:`\Phi_a(t)` and quasienergies :math:`\epsilon_\alpha` more easily than directly solving :eq:`eq_td_schrodinger`. By substituting :eq:`eq_floquet_states` into the Schrödinger equation :eq:`eq_td_schrodinger` we obtain an eigenvalue equation for the Floquet modes and quasienergies

.. math::
   :label: eq_floquet_eigen_problem

    \mathcal{H}(t)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \epsilon_\alpha\Phi_\alpha(t),

where :math:`\mathcal{H}(t) = H(t) - i\hbar\partial_t`. This eigenvalue problem could be solved analytically or numerically, but in QuTiP we use an alternative approach for numerically finding the Floquet states and quasienergies [see e.g. Creffield et al., Phys. Rev. B 67, 165301 (2003)]. Consider the propagator for the time-dependent Schrödinger equation :eq:`eq_td_schrodinger`, which by definition satisfies

.. math::

    U(T+t,t)\Psi(t) = \Psi(T+t).

Inserting the Floquet states from :eq:`eq_floquet_states` into this expression results in

.. math::
    U(T+t,t)\exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha(T+t)/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(T+t),

or, since :math:`\Phi_\alpha(T+t)=\Phi_\alpha(t)`,

.. math::
    U(T+t,t)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha T/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t) = \eta_\alpha \Phi_\alpha(t),

which shows that the Floquet modes are eigenstates of the one-period propagator. We can therefore find the Floquet modes and quasienergies :math:`\epsilon_\alpha = -\hbar\arg(\eta_\alpha)/T` by numerically calculating :math:`U(T+t,t)` and diagonalizing it. In particular this method is useful to find :math:`\Phi_\alpha(0)` by calculating and diagonalize :math:`U(T,0)`.

The Floquet modes at arbitrary time :math:`t` can then be found by propagating :math:`\Phi_\alpha(0)` to :math:`\Phi_\alpha(t)` using the wave function propagator :math:`U(t,0)\Psi_\alpha(0) = \Psi_\alpha(t)`, which for the Floquet modes yields

.. math::

    U(t,0)\Phi_\alpha(0) = \exp(-i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar)\Phi_\alpha(t),

so that :math:`\Phi_\alpha(t) = \exp(i\epsilon_\alpha t/\hbar) U(t,0)\Phi_\alpha(0)`. Since :math:`\Phi_\alpha(t)` is periodic we only need to evaluate it for :math:`t \in [0, T]`, and from :math:`\Phi_\alpha(t \in [0,T])` we can directly evaluate :math:`\Phi_\alpha(t)`, :math:`\Psi_\alpha(t)` and :math:`\Psi(t)` for arbitrary large :math:`t`.

Floquet formalism in QuTiP
--------------------------

QuTiP provides a family of functions to calculate the Floquet modes and quasi energies,
Floquet state decomposition, etc., given a time-dependent Hamiltonian.

Consider for example the case of a strongly driven two-level atom, described by the Hamiltonian

.. math::
   :label: eq_driven_qubit

    H(t) = -\frac{1}{2}\Delta\sigma_x - \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\sigma_z + \frac{1}{2}A\sin(\omega t)\sigma_z.

In QuTiP we can define this Hamiltonian as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> delta = 0.2 * 2*np.pi
   >>> eps0 = 1.0 * 2*np.pi
   >>> A = 2.5 * 2*np.pi
   >>> omega = 1.0 * 2*np.pi
   >>> H0 = - delta/2.0 * sigmax() - eps0/2.0 * sigmaz()
   >>> H1 = A/2.0 * sigmaz()
   >>> args = {'w': omega}
   >>> H = [H0, [H1, 'sin(w * t)']]

The :math:`t=0` Floquet modes corresponding to the Hamiltonian :eq:`eq_driven_qubit`
can then be calculated using the :class:`.FloquetBasis` class, which encapsulates
the Floquet modes and the quasienergies:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> T = 2*np.pi / omega
   >>> floquet_basis = FloquetBasis(H, T, args)
   >>> f_energies = floquet_basis.e_quasi
   >>> f_energies # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
   array([-2.83131212,  2.83131212])
   >>> f_modes_0 = floquet_basis.mode(0)
   >>> f_modes_0 # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
   [Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket
   Qobj data =
   [[ 0.72964231+0.j      ]
    [-0.39993746+0.554682j]],
   Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket
   Qobj data =
   [[0.39993746+0.554682j]
    [0.72964231+0.j      ]]]

For some problems interesting observations can be draw from the quasienergy levels alone.
Consider for example the quasienergies for the driven two-level system introduced
above as a function of the driving amplitude, calculated and plotted in the following example.
For certain driving amplitudes the quasienergy levels cross.
Since the quasienergies can be associated with the time-scale of the long-term dynamics
due that the driving, degenerate quasienergies indicates a "freezing" of the dynamics
(sometimes known as coherent destruction of tunneling).

   :context: close-figs

   >>> delta = 0.2 * 2 * np.pi
   >>> eps0  = 0.0 * 2 * np.pi
   >>> omega = 1.0 * 2 * np.pi
   >>> A_vec = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) * omega
   >>> T = (2 * np.pi) / omega
   >>> tlist = np.linspace(0.0, 10 * T, 101)
   >>> spsi0 = basis(2, 0)
   >>> q_energies = np.zeros((len(A_vec), 2))
   >>> H0 = delta / 2.0 * sigmaz() - eps0 / 2.0 * sigmax()
   >>> args = {'w': omega}
   >>> for idx, A in enumerate(A_vec): # doctest: +SKIP
   >>>   H1 = A / 2.0 * sigmax() # doctest: +SKIP
   >>>   H = [H0, [H1, lambda t, args: np.sin(args['w'] * t)]] # doctest: +SKIP

   >>> plt.figure() # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> plt.plot(A_vec/omega, q_energies[:,0] / delta, 'b', A_vec/omega, q_energies[:,1] / delta, 'r') # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> plt.xlabel(r'$A/\omega$') # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> plt.ylabel(r'Quasienergy / $\Delta$') # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> plt.title(r'Floquet quasienergies') # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> plt.show() # doctest: +SKIP

Given the Floquet modes at :math:`t=0`, we obtain the Floquet mode at some later
time :math:`t` using :meth:`.FloquetBasis.mode`:

.. plot::
   :context: close-figs

   >>> f_modes_t = floquet_basis.mode(2.5)
   >>> f_modes_t # doctest: +SKIP
   [Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket
   Qobj data =
   [[-0.89630512-0.23191946j]
    [ 0.37793106-0.00431336j]],
   Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket
   Qobj data =
   [[-0.37793106-0.00431336j]
    [-0.89630512+0.23191946j]]]

The purpose of calculating the Floquet modes is to find the wavefunction solution
to the original problem :eq:`eq_driven_qubit` given some initial state :math:`\left|\psi_0\right>`.
To do that, we first need to decompose the initial state in the Floquet states,
using the function :meth:`.FloquetBasis.to_floquet_basis`

.. plot::
   :context: close-figs

   >>> psi0 = rand_ket(2)
   >>> f_coeff = floquet_basis.to_floquet_basis(psi0)
   >>> f_coeff # doctest: +SKIP
   [(-0.645265993068382+0.7304552549315746j),
   (0.15517002114250228-0.1612116102238258j)]

and given this decomposition of the initial state in the Floquet states we can easily
evaluate the wavefunction that is the solution to :eq:`eq_driven_qubit` at an arbitrary
time :math:`t` using the function :meth:`.FloquetBasis.from_floquet_basis`:

.. plot::
   :context: close-figs

   >>> t = 10 * np.random.rand()
   >>> psi_t = floquet_basis.from_floquet_basis(f_coeff, t)

The following example illustrates how to use the functions introduced above to calculate
and plot the time-evolution of :eq:`eq_driven_qubit`.

Pre-computing the Floquet modes for one period
----------------------------------------------

When evaluating the Floquet states or the wavefunction at many points in time it
is useful to pre-compute the Floquet modes for the first period of the driving with
the required times. The list of times to pre-compute modes for may be passed to
:class:`.FloquetBasis` using ``precompute=tlist``, and then
:meth:`.FloquetBasis.from_floquet_basis` and  :meth:`.FloquetBasis.to_floquet_basis`
can be used to efficiently retrieve the wave function at the pre-computed times.
The following example illustrates how the example from the previous section can be
solved more efficiently using these functions for pre-computing the Floquet modes:

.. plot:: guide/scripts/floquet_ex2.py
   :width: 4.0in
   :include-source:

Note that the parameters and the Hamiltonian used in this example is not the same as
in the previous section, and hence the different appearance of the resulting figure.

For convenience, all the steps described above for calculating the evolution of a
quantum system using the Floquet formalisms are encapsulated in the function :func:`.fsesolve`.
Using this function, we could have achieved the same results as in the examples above using

.. code-block:: python

    output = fsesolve(H, psi0=psi0, tlist=tlist, e_ops=[qutip.num(2)], args=args)
    p_ex = output.expect[0]

.. _floquet-dissipative:

Floquet theory for dissipative evolution
========================================

A driven system that is interacting with its environment is not necessarily well
described by the standard Lindblad master equation, since its dissipation process
could be time-dependent due to the driving. In such cases a rigorious approach would
be to take the driving into account when deriving the master equation. This can be
done in many different ways, but one way common approach is to derive the master
equation in the Floquet basis. That approach results in the so-called Floquet-Markov
master equation, see Grifoni et al., Physics Reports 304, 299 (1998) for details.

For a brief summary of the derivation, the important contents for the implementation
in QuTiP are listed below.

The floquet mode :math:`\ket{\phi_\alpha(t)}` refers to a full class of quasienergies
defined by :math:`\epsilon_\alpha + k \Omega` for arbitrary :math:`k`. Hence, the
quasienenergy difference between two floquet modes is given by

.. math::
    \Delta_{\alpha \beta k} = \frac{\epsilon_\alpha - \epsilon_\beta}{\hbar} + k \Omega

For any coupling operator :math:`q` (given by the user) the matrix elements in
the floquet basis are calculated as:

.. math::
    X_{\alpha \beta k} = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T dt \; e^{-ik \Omega t} \bra{\phi_\alpha(t)}q\ket{\phi_\beta(t)}

From the matrix elements and the spectral density :math:`J(\omega)`, the decay
rate :math:`\gamma_{\alpha \beta k}` is defined:

.. math::
    \gamma_{\alpha \beta k} = 2 \pi J(\Delta_{\alpha \beta k}) | X_{\alpha \beta k}|^2

The master equation is further simplified by the RWA, which makes the following matrix useful:

.. math::
    A_{\alpha \beta} = \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty [\gamma_{\alpha \beta k} + n_{th}(|\Delta_{\alpha \beta k}|)(\gamma_{\alpha \beta k} + \gamma_{\alpha \beta -k})

The density matrix of the system then evolves according to:

.. math::
    \dot{\rho}_{\alpha \alpha}(t) = \sum_\nu (A_{\alpha \nu} \rho_{\nu \nu}(t) - A_{\nu \alpha} \rho_{\alpha \alpha} (t))

.. math::
    \dot{\rho}_{\alpha \beta}(t) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_\nu (A_{\nu \alpha} + A_{\nu \beta}) \rho_{\alpha \beta}(t) \qquad \alpha \neq \beta


The Floquet-Markov master equation in QuTiP
-------------------------------------------

The QuTiP function :func:`.fmmesolve` implements the Floquet-Markov master equation.
It calculates the dynamics of a system given its initial state, a time-dependent
Hamiltonian, a list of operators through which the system couples to its environment
and a list of corresponding spectral-density functions that describes the environment.
In contrast to the :func:`.mesolve` and :func:`.mcsolve`, and the :func:`.fmmesolve`
does characterize the environment with dissipation rates, but extract the strength
of the coupling to the environment from the noise spectral-density functions and
the instantaneous Hamiltonian parameters (similar to the Bloch-Redfield master
equation solver :func:`.brmesolve`).

.. note::

    Currently the :func:`.fmmesolve` can only accept a single environment coupling
    operator and spectral-density function.

The noise spectral-density function of the environment is implemented as a Python
callback function that is passed to the solver. For example:


.. code-block:: python

    gamma1 = 0.1
    def noise_spectrum(omega):
        return (omega>0) * 0.5 * gamma1 * omega/(2*pi)

The other parameters are similar to the :func:`.mesolve` and :func:`.mcsolve`,
and the same format for the return value is used :class:`.Result`.
The following example extends the example studied above, and uses :func:`.fmmesolve`
to introduce dissipation into the calculation

.. plot:: guide/scripts/floquet_ex3.py
   :width: 4.0in
   :include-source:

Finally, :func:`.fmmesolve`  always expects the ``e_ops`` to
be specified in the laboratory basis (as for other solvers) and we can calculate
expectation values using:

.. code-block:: python

    output = fmmesolve(H, psi0, tlist, [sigmax()], e_ops=[num(2)],
                       spectra_cb=[noise_spectrum], T=T, args=args)
    p_ex = output.expect[0]

.. plot::
    :context: reset
    :include-source: false
    :nofigs:

The Floquet-Lindblad master equation in QuTiP
---------------------------------------------
The QuTiP function :func:`qutip.floquet.flimesolve` implements the 
Floquet-Lindblad master equation. It calculates the dynamics of a system given 
its initial state, a time-dependent Hamiltonian, and a list of operators 
through which the system couples to its environment. More information on 
the Floquet-Lindblad master equation can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18046

The following example extends the example studied above, and uses 
:func:`qutip.floquet.flimesolve` to introduce dissipation into the calculation.


.. plot:: guide/scripts/floquet_ex4.py
   :width: 4.0in
   :include-source:
   
Importantly, the default solution method used by FLiMESolve will change, depending
on the physical parameters of the system and the user inputs. A system
with no time dependence can be solved in the full secular approximation, 
whereas a system with complicated time-dependence will need a more relaxed 
secular approximation. To adress this, FLiMESolve does have one additional input, 
relative to MESolve. This property is the relative secular approximation,
which allows for the secular approximation used in the Lindblad equation to 
be relaxed. This is in contrast to FMMESolve, which uses the most restrictive 
form of the secular approximation. The value of relative secular approximation goes as

.. math::
    time sensitivity = (\omega_{1}-\omega_{2})/(S_{1}\S_{2})
    
where :math:'\omega_{n},S_{n}' are the rotation frequency and rate of the 
:math:'n^th' index of the Fourier-decomposed system operators in the Lindblad
equation. Essentially, this value compares the rotation rate of a term in the
master equation to the strength with which that component affects the system. 
Large values mean that the component rotates quickly, relative to its contribution to the 
system motion, so that overall the movement averages out on larger timescales.
Smaller values have the converse meaning, such that overall the quotient can be
understood to be a  "negligibility factor," with higher values being
more negligible. The value of the relative secular approximation sets the value 
above which terms will be ignored. The default value of this input is zero, but 
it can be set to higher values to more accurately recover the behavior of a 
system.

   :width: 4.0in
   :include-source:

Finally, for the sake of clarity, :func:`qutip.solver.floquet.fmmesolve`, 
similar to :func:`qutip.solver.floquet.flimesolve`, always expects the 
``e_ops`` to be specified in the laboratory basis:

    output = flimesolve(H, psi0, tlist, [[sigmax() * gamma1**0.5 ]], e_ops=[num(2)], T=T, args=args)
    p_ex = output.expect[0]
