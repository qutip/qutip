QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python
================================
QuTiP is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of 
open quantum systems.  The QuTiP library depends on the 
excellent Numpy and Scipy numerical packages. In addition, 
graphical output is provided by Matplotlib.  QuTiP aims
to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations
of a wide variety of Hamiltonian's, including those with 
arbitrary time-dependence, commonly found in a wide range of 
physics applications. QuTiP is freely available for use and/or 
modification on all major platforms. Being free of any licensing 
fees, QuTiP is ideal for exploring quantum mechanics and 
dynamics in the classroom.
