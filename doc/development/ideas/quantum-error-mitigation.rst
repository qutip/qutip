From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum
circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a
pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class
`Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms
for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the
corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers.
Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a
quantum device.

This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new
device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general
framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible
applications such as error mitigation techniques ([1]_, [2]_, [3]_).

The tutorial notebooks can be found at https://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A
recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview
(https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github
Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests.

Expected outcomes
=================

- Make an overview of existing libraries and features in error mitigation,
  similarly to a literature survey for a research article, but for a code
  project (starting from Refs. [4]_, [5]_). This is done in order to best
  integrate the features in QuTiP with existing libraries and avoid
  reinventing the wheel.
- Features to perform error mitigation techniques in QuTiP, such as zero-noise
  extrapolation by pulse stretching.
- Tutorials implementing basic quantum error mitigation protocols
- Possible integration with Mitiq [6]_
