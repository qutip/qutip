Version 4.6.1 (May 4, 2021)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This minor release fixes bugs in QIP gate definitions, fixes building from
the source tarball when git is not installed and works around an MKL
bug in versions of SciPy <= 1.4.

It also adds the ``[full]`` pip install target so that ``pip install qutip[full]``
installs qutip and all of its optional and developer dependencies.

Improvements
------------
- Add the ``[full]`` pip install target (by **Jake Lishman**)

Bug Fixes
---------
- Work around pointer MKL eigh bug in SciPy <= 1.4 (by **Felipe Bivort Haiek**)

Version 4.6.0 (April 11, 2021)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This release brings improvements for qubit circuits, including a pulse scheduler, measurement statistics, reading/writing OpenQASM and optimisations in the circuit simulations.

This is the first release to have full binary wheel releases on pip; you can now do ``pip install qutip`` on almost any machine to get a correct version of the package without needing any compilers set up.
The support for Numpy 1.20 that was first added in QuTiP 4.5.3 is present in this version as well, and the same build considerations mentioned there apply here too.
If building using the now-supported PEP 517 mechanisms (e.g. ``python -mbuild /path/to/qutip``), all build dependencies will be correctly satisfied.

Improvements
------------
- **MAJOR** Add saving, loading and resetting functionality to ``qutip.settings`` for easy re-configuration. (by **Eric Giguère**)
- **MAJOR** Add a quantum gate scheduler in ``qutip.qip.scheduler``, to help parallelise the operations of quantum gates.  This supports two scheduling modes: as late as possible, and as soon as possible. (by **Boxi Li**)
- **MAJOR** Improved qubit circuit simulators, including OpenQASM support and performance optimisations. (by **Sidhant Saraogi**)
- **MAJOR** Add tools for quantum measurements and their statistics. (by **Simon Cross** and **Sidhant Saraogi**)
- Add support for Numpy 1.20.  QuTiP should be compiled against a version of Numpy ``>= 1.16.6`` and ``< 1.20`` (note: does _not_ include 1.20 itself), but such an installation is compatible with any modern version of Numpy.  Source installations from ``pip`` understand this constraint.
- Improve the error message when circuit plotting fails. (by **Boxi Li**)
- Add support for parsing M1 Mac hardware information. (by **Xiaoliang Wu**)
- Add more single-qubit gates and controlled gates. (by **Mateo Laguna** and **Martín Sande Costa**)
- Support decomposition of ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` gates in circuits. (by **Boxi Li**)
- Refactor ``QubitCircuit.resolve_gate()`` (by **Martín Sande Costa**)

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fix ``dims`` in the returns from ``Qobj.eigenstates`` on superoperators. (by **Jake Lishman**)
- Calling Numpy ufuncs on ``Qobj`` will now correctly raise a ``TypeError`` rather than returning a nonsense ``ndarray``. (by **Jake Lishman**)
- Convert segfault into Python exception when creating too-large tensor products. (by **Jake Lishman**)
- Correctly set ``num_collapse`` in the output of ``mesolve``. (by **Jake Lishman**)
- Fix ``ptrace`` when all subspaces are being kept, or the subspaces are passed in order. (by **Jake Lishman**)
- Fix sorting bug in ``Bloch3d.add_points()``. (by **pschindler**)

- Fix sparse matrix construction in PIQS when using Scipy 1.6.1. (by **Drew Parsons**)
- Fix ``zspmv_openmp.cpp`` missing from the pip sdist. (by **Christoph Gohlke**)
- Fix correlation functions throwing away imaginary components. (by **Asier Galicia Martinez**)

- Fix the broken LaTeX image conversion. (by **Jake Lishman**)
- Fix gate resolution of the FREDKIN gate. (by **Bo Yang**)
- Fix broken formatting in docstrings. (by **Jake Lishman**)

Deprecations
------------
- ``eseries``, ``essolve`` and ``ode2es`` are all deprecated, pending removal in QuTiP 5.0.  These are legacy functions and classes that have been left unmaintained for a long time, and their functionality is now better achieved with ``QobjEvo`` or ``mesolve``.

Developer Changes
-----------------
- **MAJOR** Overhaul of setup and packaging code to make it satisfy PEP 517, and move the build to a matrix on GitHub Actions in order to release binary wheels on pip for all major platforms and supported Python versions. (by **Jake Lishman**)
- Default arguments in ``Qobj`` are now ``None`` rather than mutable types. (by **Jake Lishman**)
- Fixed comsumable iterators being used to parametrise some tests, preventing the testing suite from being re-run within the same session. (by **Jake Lishman**)
- Remove unused imports, simplify some floats and remove unnecessary list conversions. (by **jakobjakobson13**)
- Improve Travis jobs matrix for specifying the testing containers. (by **Jake Lishman**)
- Fix coverage reporting on Travis. (by **Jake Lishman**)
- Added a ``pyproject.toml`` file. (by **Simon Humpohl** and **Eric Giguère**)
- Add doctests to documentation. (by **Sidhant Saraogi**)
- Fix all warnings in the documentation build. (by **Jake Lishman**)



Version 4.5.3 (February 19, 2021)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This patch release adds support for Numpy 1.20, made necessary by changes to how array-like objects are handled. There are no other changes relative to version 4.5.2.

Users building from source should ensure that they build against Numpy versions >= 1.16.6 and < 1.20 (not including 1.20 itself), but after that or for those installing from conda, an installation will support any current Numpy version >= 1.16.6.

Improvements
------------
- Add support for Numpy 1.20.  QuTiP should be compiled against a version of Numpy ``>= 1.16.6`` and ``< 1.20`` (note: does _not_ include 1.20 itself), but such an installation is compatible with any modern version of Numpy.  Source installations from ``pip`` understand this constraint.



Version 4.5.2 (July 14, 2020)

Version 3.2.0 (Never officially released)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
------------

*Core libraries*

- **MAJOR FEATURE**: Non-Markovian solvers: Hierarchy (**Added by Neill Lambert**), Memory-Cascade, and Transfer-Tensor methods.
- **MAJOR FEATURE**: Default steady state solver now up to 100x faster using the Intel Pardiso library under the Anaconda and Intel Python distributions.
- The default Wigner function now uses a Clenshaw summation algorithm to evaluate a polynomial series that is applicable for any number of exciations (previous limitation was ~50 quanta), and is ~3x faster than before. (**Added by Denis Vasilyev**)
- Can now define a given eigen spectrum for random Hermitian and density operators.
- The Qobj ``expm`` method now uses the equivilent SciPy routine, and performs a much faster ``exp`` operation if the matrix is diagonal.
- One can now build zero operators using the ``qzero`` function.

*Control modules*

- **MAJOR FEATURE**: CRAB algorithm added
  This is an alternative to the GRAPE algorithm, which allows for analytical control functions, which means that experimental constraints can more easily be added into optimisation.
  See tutorial notebook for full information.


Improvements
------------
*Core libraries*

- Two-time correlation functions can now be calculated for fully time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators. (**Added by Kevin Fischer**)
- The code for the inverse-power method for the steady state solver has been simplified.
- Bloch-Redfield tensor creation is now up to an order of magnitude faster. (**Added by Johannes Feist**)
- Q.transform now works properly for arrays directly from sp_eigs (or eig).
- Q.groundstate now checks for degeneracy.
- Added ``sinm`` and ``cosm`` methods to the Qobj class.
- Added ``charge`` and ``tunneling`` operators.
- Time-dependent Cython code is now easier to read and debug.


*Control modules*

- The internal state / quantum operator data type can now be either Qobj or ndarray
  Previous only ndarray was possible. This now opens up possibility of using Qobj methods in fidelity calculations
  The attributes and functions that return these operators are now preceded by an underscore, to indicate that the data type could change depending on the configuration options.
  In most cases these functions were for internal processing only anyway, and should have been 'private'.
  Accessors to the properties that could be useful outside of the library have been added. These always return Qobj. If the internal operator data type is not Qobj, then there could be signicant overhead in the conversion, and so this should be avoided during pulse optimisation.
  If custom sub-classes are developed that use Qobj properties and methods (e.g. partial trace), then it is very likely that it will be more efficient to set the internal data type to Qobj.
  The internal operator data will be chosen automatically based on the size and sparsity of the dynamics generator. It can be forced by setting ``dynamics.oper_dtype = <type>``
  Note this can be done by passing ``dyn_params={'oper_dtype':<type>}`` in any of the pulseoptim functions.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
------------

- New module `qutip.stochastic` with stochastic master equation and stochastic
  Schrödinger equation solvers.

  favor of ``steadystate``. The steadystate solver no longer use umfpack by
  default. New pre-processing methods for reordering and balancing the linear
  equation system used in direct solution of the steady state.

- New module `qutip.qip` with utilities for quantum information processing,
  including pre-defined quantum gates along with functions for expanding
  arbitrary 1, 2, and 3 qubit gates to N qubit registers, circuit
  representations, library of quantum algorithms, and basic physical models for
  some common QIP architectures.

- New module `qutip.distributions` with unified API for working with
  distribution functions.

- New format for defining time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators,
  using a pre-calculated numpy array that specifies the values of the
  Qobj-coefficients for each time step.

- New functions for working with different superoperator representations,
  including Kraus and Chi representation.

- New functions for visualizing quantum states using Qubism and Schimdt plots:
  ``plot_qubism`` and ``plot_schmidt``.

- Dynamics solver now support taking argument ``e_ops`` (expectation value
  operators) in dictionary form.

- Public plotting functions from the ``qutip.visualization`` module are now
  prefixed with ``plot_`` (e.g., ``plot_fock_distribution``). The
  ``plot_wigner`` and ``plot_wigner_fock_distribution`` now supports 3D views
  in addition to contour views.

- New API and new functions for working with spin operators and states,
  including for example ``spin_Jx``, ``spin_Jy``, ``spin_Jz`` and
  ``spin_state``, ``spin_coherent``.

- The ``expect`` function now supports a list of operators, in addition to the
  previously supported list of states.

- Simplified creation of qubit states using ``ket`` function.

- The module ``qutip.cyQ`` has been renamed to ``qutip.cy`` and the sparse
  matrix-vector functions ``spmv`` and ``spmv1d`` has been combined into one
  function ``spmv``. New functions for operating directly on the underlaying
  sparse CSR data have been added (e.g., ``spmv_csr``). Performance
  improvements. New and improved Cython functions for calculating expectation
  values for state vectors, density matrices in matrix and vector form.

- The ``concurrence`` function now supports both pure and mixed states. Added
  function for calculating the entangling power of a two-qubit gate.

  QuTiP web site. The ``qutip.gui`` module has been renamed to ``qutip.ui`` and
  does no longer contain graphical UI elements. New text-based and HTML-based
  progressbar classes.

- Support for harmonic oscillator operators/states in a Fock state basis that
  does not start from zero (e.g., in the range [M,N+1]). Support for
  eliminating and extracting states from Qobj instances (e.g., removing one
  state from a two-qubit system to obtain a three-level system).

- Support for time-dependent Hamiltonian and Liouvillian callback functions that
  depend on the instantaneous state, which for example can be used for solving
  master equations with mean field terms.

Improvements
------------

- Restructured and optimized implementation of Qobj, which now has
  significantly lower memory footprint due to avoiding excessive copying of
  internal matrix data.

- The classes ``OdeData``, ``Odeoptions``, ``Odeconfig`` are now called
  ``Result``, ``Options``, and ``Config``, respectively, and are available in
  the module `qutip.solver`.

- The ``squeez`` function has been renamed to ``squeeze``.

- Better support for sparse matrices when calculating propagators using the
  ``propagator`` function.

- Improved Bloch sphere.

- Restructured and improved the module ``qutip.sparse``, which now only
  operates directly on sparse matrices (not on Qobj instances).

- Improved and simplified implement of the ``tensor`` function.

- Improved performance, major code cleanup (including namespace changes),
  and numerous bug fixes.

- Benchmark scripts improved and restructured.
